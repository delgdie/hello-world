# hello-world

Hi guys! I'm new to the Github world and my professor Haohan Li is teaching me some very cool stuff
All types of things such as Python, C++, CSharp and many more!
Stay tuned for some kick ass scripts!
I hope by the time i'm done my training I will be able to contribute and help the community!
